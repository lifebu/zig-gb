# Testing 
- using the blargg-gb test roms I can run them and wait until they are finished.
- they are finished when the cpu has reached an JR instruction that jumps to itself (endless loop).
- then you can compare the pixels of the cpu texture with pixels of a known good screenshot.
- if they differ => something failed.

- Every test seems to use the same tileset it loads. 
- If that is the case, we could then use the tilemap data in memory and convert that into a message.
- This means, that I can decode the actual message on screen. 
- And this means the test can run headless.
