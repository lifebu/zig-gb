- Run bgb and my emulator side by side, bgb is focused and my emulator still reads input while unfocused (parameter?)
    - use a custom bgb.ini file for positioning bgb?
    - position my emulator differently? (position as parameter?).
    - Needs which rom to load as parameter to my code.
    - My own config.json?
- Make the PPU run on cycle? How much work would that be?
- Doing this before testing would be neat to have a system that is proven good before the rework.
- Cleanup CPU code!
- Support MBC5 (pokemon_blu)
- Testing:
    - CPU: 
        - Use SingleStepTests Cycles (in the json) length + 1 to test if my instructions have the right timing.
        - Disable MMU checks for tests (runtime check for now).
        - SingleStepTests are generated from raddad772/jsmoo (misc/code_generation/sm83_tests/generation.js).
    - Joypad: Test different InputState combinations and the resulting bit with test flags?
    - Timer & Divider:
    - Interrupts:
    - PPU:
        - 1st: MemoryDump + Picture => Compare them.
        - 2nd: MemoryDump + Picture + CPUWriteList (perCycle) => Compare them.
            - Compare each written pixel?
            - MemoryDump: When VBlank starts?
            - CPUWriteList: Not each Write to PPU accessible memory.
    - TestRoms:
        - Blargg (CPU)
        - MealyBug (PPU)
        - Mooneye (All)
        - Acid2 (PPU)
        - SameSuite (All)
