- Implement CPU to work on cycles (Use Lagcycle approach, the cpu runs one instruction ahead, the hardware catches up).
    - Otherwise timer and joypad don't work.
    - only do ppu once per frame.
- Add that the ppu fakes the status registers each frame (LY, Modes).
    - Just so that some games can already run with that fake ppu!
- Fix rest of TODOs from mmio:
    - Correct interrupt flag implementation.
    - Interrupt routine overlay.
- Cleanup CPU code!
